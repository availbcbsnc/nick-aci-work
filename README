To run any of the scripts:

    python3 modify_ports.py 
    Input fabric (qic, atl, brm or clt): qic
    Are you sure you want to select qic? (y or n): y
    Input username: username
    Is this the correct username? username (y or n): y
    Input password: 
    Would you like to re-type your password? (y or n): n

    Is this the correct change number? test_change (y or n): y

    OR

    python3 <script name> --fabric <fabric name> --user <username> --pass <password> --chg <change number>

    script name - name of the script
    fabric name - qic, atl, brm, clt
    username - your username (put in single quotes if it contains special characters)
    password - your password (put in single quotes if it contains special characters)
    change # - put your change # or an identifier for the change

Each script will also run the get_token.py and the snapshot.py script
    1. logs in to the fabric and saves the token
    2. creates a pre-change snapshot before any changes are made.
    3. Creates a post-change snapshot at the end of the script

Each script will contain logs after they are run. They can be found in the /logs folder.
